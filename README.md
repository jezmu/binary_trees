Binary Trees
This project has everything to do with understanding the binary tree data structure and all its operations, it also shows how binary search tree is a special type of binary tree. I understood binary tree when implementing the tasks.

RESOURCES I USED TO LEARN BINARY TREES:
What is a binary tree?
Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree
Tree Tranversal
Binary Search Tree
Data Structures: Binary Tree
